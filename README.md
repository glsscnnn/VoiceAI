## VoiceAI

Voice recognition AI, for recognizing words this project was
supposed to be used at dell for something but unlucky COVID

the project still has a lot of refinement and such to go through
before it's actually ready to be used

many teqniques here are from tensorflow's audio tutorial using
a predetermined dataset and supervised learning methods.

## Future Improvements

Training on a larger more varied dataset, larger model with more
parameters, etc. This is datascience what can I say all you do
is get more data and train with more params util your model is 
good enough this model at the moment is very bad and is not
recommended to use. Would recommend using pretrained model.

Maybe if I want to sit down and make a bunch of data this could
work but really I don't have time or resources to do this so 
using other people's datasets or using a pretrained model is the
best we can do.
